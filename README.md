# CUDA_Box-filter

> This repository has been created for college assignments in the Advanced Computer Architecture subject during the summer semester of 2022/2023.

## Exercises

- [Exercise 1 - CPU threads](exercise-1/README.md)
- [Exercise 2 - Thread synchronization and mutex](exercise-2/README.md)

## Project

Project is demonstrating implementation of the box filter for
- CPU
  - Single thread
- GPU
  - Without shared memory usage
  - With shared memory usage

Project is written in the form of Jupyter Notebook and developed with Google Colab (GPU).

👉 [Project Notebook](./project/CUDA_Project_2023.ipynb)

### Key features
- filter results generated by different algorithms are asserted using checksum inside Google Colab Notebook, to skip slow file download from Google Colab
- CPU/GPU speed comparison analytics are build automatically with python script

### Results
Following 4 images demonstrate filter usage (original images were resized).

<table style="text-align:center">
